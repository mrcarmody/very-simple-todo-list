# Very Simple Todo List 
## Built using [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter)

This is a very simple todo app that lets one record, edit, complete and delete todo items.

In practice, I would normally use JavaScript and Ajax requests to make a UI more fluid and responsive, but in this case I wrote the app using only PHP to demonstrate my comfort and ability with programming using Object Oriented code in PHP.

To use the app, clone the git repo into your server enviornment and follow the CodeIgniter [Installation Guide](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/installation/index.html) to get the app up and running.  Please feel free post an issue to this repo or [email me](mailto:mr.carmody@gmail.com) if you need help getting the app working.
