# Very Simple Todo List 
## Built using [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter)

This is a very simple todo app that lets one record, edit, complete and delete todo items.

In practice, I would normally use JavaScript and Ajax requests to make a UI more fluid and responsive, but in this case I wrote the app using only PHP to demonstrate my comfort and ability with programming using Object Oriented code in PHP.

The interesting files in the repo are:   
- the [todo_model](https://github.com/mrcarmody/very-simple-todo-list/blob/master/application/models/todo_model.php)  
- the [views](https://github.com/mrcarmody/very-simple-todo-list/tree/master/application/views)  
- the [todo controller](https://github.com/mrcarmody/very-simple-todo-list/blob/master/application/controllers/todo.php)  
- the [tests](https://github.com/mrcarmody/very-simple-todo-list/blob/master/application/controllers/tests.php)

You can see a [live demo here](http://ec2-54-187-253-139.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/todo) and run the [unit tests here](http://ec2-54-187-253-139.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/tests).

To setup the app in your enviornment, clone the git repo into your server and follow the CodeIgniter [Installation Guide](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/installation/index.html) to get the app up and running.  Please feel free post an issue to this repo or [email me](mailto:mr.carmody@gmail.com) if you need help getting the app working.
